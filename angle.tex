Angle of arrival or Direction of arrival can be used to estimate the location of a transmitter. The signal directions are considered as straight lines and the intersection of the several pairs of these lines indicate the location of the transmitter. AoA is detected with the help of i) using rotatable antennas i.e. directional antennas. ii) multiple static antenna arrays iii) Beamforming techniques. In one method estimation is done using antenna arrays with array geometry and measuring differences in signal arrival times. Another method uses antenna arrays and RSSI ratios at each antenna to estimate AoA. Beamforming techniques are also used to shape the radiation pattern. 
A verification system verifies the calculated AoA with our estimated Angle. If these doesnâ€™t match, then it means there is an attack.
