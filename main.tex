\begin{abstract}
    Many applications are relying on location for various purposes in their activity, in general users need to advertise their own position to the server and can then spoof it. This can be dangerous in many contexts, from secure networks to aircraft. In this paper we are going to discuss about how to securely verify the location in wireless networks by exploiting physical properties of the incoming signals. It is indeed possible to determine, based on some measured parameters, if a location claim can be trustworthy and there are several methods how to do that. We are going through some of the physical properties that can be exploited for this purpose, pointing out advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches.

\section{Introduction}
Throughout this paper, we are going to discuss models in which a user needs to communicate its location to to the service handlers. We will refer as the former as \emph{prover}, since its job is to \emph{prove} its location, while the latter will be referred as \emph{verifier}, whose job is basically to check the prover's location. If not differently specified, all the communication happen in a wireless network, where the opponents can exchange radio messages.

In the next sections we will analyse separately each physical property: received angle, time of reception, signal strength, etc. For each of them we will point out strengths and weaknesses of the approach, to make clear in which application may them be effectively used and when they might not be a good option.
